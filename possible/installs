### `setup.sh` (for Linux/macOS)
The `setup.sh` script is used to automate the setup process on Linux or macOS. This typically includes setting up a Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, and any other necessary configurations for your project.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Python is installed
if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null
then
    echo "Python3 could not be found, please install it first."
    exit
fi

# Create a virtual environment
echo "Creating Python virtual environment..."
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
echo "Upgrading pip..."
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
if [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
    echo "Installing dependencies from requirements.txt..."
    pip install -r requirements.txt
else
    echo "requirements.txt not found, skipping dependencies installation."
fi

# Additional setup commands
echo "Running additional setup commands..."
# You can add any additional setup steps here, e.g., database migrations, setting up environment variables, etc.

echo "Setup complete! To activate the environment, run: source venv/bin/activate"
```

### Usage for `setup.sh`:
1. Give it executable permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

### `install.bat` (for Windows)
The `install.bat` script performs a similar function on Windows, automating the setup process by creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running other necessary setup commands.

```batch
@echo off
:: Check if Python is installed
python --version >nul 2>&1
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo Python3 is not installed. Please install Python3 and try again.
    exit /b 1
)

:: Create a virtual environment
echo Creating Python virtual environment...
python -m venv venv

:: Activate the virtual environment
call venv\Scripts\activate

:: Upgrade pip
echo Upgrading pip...
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

:: Install required dependencies
IF EXIST requirements.txt (
    echo Installing dependencies from requirements.txt...
    pip install -r requirements.txt
) ELSE (
    echo requirements.txt not found, skipping dependencies installation.
)

:: Additional setup commands
echo Running additional setup commands...
:: Add any additional setup steps here

echo Setup complete! To activate the environment, run: venv\Scripts\activate
pause
```

### Usage for `install.bat`:
1. Double-click `install.bat` to run the setup process, or run it in the command prompt:
   ```batch
   install.bat
   ```

### Explanation:
1. **Creating Virtual Environments**: Both scripts create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
2. **Installing Dependencies**: Both scripts check for the `requirements.txt` file and install the necessary Python libraries.
3. **Additional Setup**: You can extend both scripts with more commands for database migrations, environment variables, etc.

This setup ensures your project can be easily deployed across different operating systems, whether Linux, macOS, or Windows.
